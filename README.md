# Welcome to floresql.com üëã

Hey there! Welcome to my personal portfolio and resume website, [floresql.com](https://floresql.com). 

## About Me ‚ÑπÔ∏è

I've recently embarked on a journey of learning and discovery by enrolling in the Master of Data Science program at Regis University where I hope to gain a deeper understanding of predictive analytics, statistics, data visualization, and data engineering. But learning new tech doesn‚Äôt stop in the classroom. I have also immersed myself in solving problems, taking on challenges, and completing courses through platforms like Coursera, Kaggle, and HackerRank. While getting back in to the tech world I decided to dust of my Web Dev skills and create this site so I could play around with some new tech toys!

# Goals üéØ

- Relearn and update my coding skills in languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Explore new frameworks and tools like React, Node.js, and Docker.
- Dive deep into modern software engineering practices such as Agile methodologies, DevOps, and cloud computing.
- Contribute to open-source projects and engage with the developer community to stay connected and updated with the latest trends.
