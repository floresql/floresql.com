After a pivot more into the business side of things, I'm getting back into the tech world, eager to explore new technologies and methodologies. This website will not only serve as a platform to showcase my skills, it will also be a platform where I can document my journey of learning and growth as I explore and adapt to new technologies and industry trends in the field of software engineering.
